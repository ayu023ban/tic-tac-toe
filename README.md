# Tic Tac Toe

This is a complete and an awesome **_Tic Tac Toe_** game, with a great design and all the necessary features you could think of (check [Features](#features) for more details).

**_Artificial Intelligence_**: To create the **_AI_** for this game I used the [Mini-Max](https://www.javatpoint.com/mini-max-algorithm-in-ai) algorithm, a recursive or backtracking algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory.
